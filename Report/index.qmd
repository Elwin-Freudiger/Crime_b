## X. RoadMap
What is left to do for our report?

As things stand, we still need to run our regression and analyse its results.
We also need to answer our research questions. 

If possible we would also like to run a PCA analysis on the different types of crimes to see if certain states experience a type of crime more often than others, and if some crimes can be related. 

We would also like to tweak various parts of our report, for example, we still need to add more graphs and at least one interactive map using the leaflet package. 

We would also like to develop our EDA section by adding more information on our raw databases, with information regarding the missing values or the distribution of values.
