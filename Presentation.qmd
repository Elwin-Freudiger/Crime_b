# Introduction

![](https://i1.hespress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/france-police-9.jpg)

## Research questions

-   **Can the criminality rate in France be explained using the unemployment rate ?**

-   **Can the criminality rate in France be explained using the poverty rate ?**

-   **Can the criminality rate in France be explained using education indicators ?**

-   **Can the density of population in territories explain criminality ?**

-   **Can the immigration rate explain criminality ?**

-   **Can the previous presidential results in territories have an impact on criminality ?**

-   **Is there a correlation between these mentioned variables ?**

## Motivations

Crime is a polarizing topic, most people do not agree on what causes crime. A statistical analysis could give leads into the causes of criminality.

# Variables

We will consider the following macroeconomic variables:

-   Poverty rate

-   Unemployment rate

-   Percentage of people above 25 without a diploma

-   Density of Population

-   Results of previous presidential elections

-   Immigration

## Extreme values {.smaller}

Most of our dataset were challenging to use because there were some surprising extreme values.

Lessons from our datasets:

Paris is an outlier, proven by clustering

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cluster_map
```

## Surprising values {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Some villages "Died for France", now have population of 0.

High crime rate in:

-   Touristic destinations

-   Airports

Density varies and may be very low in some towns because of Natural Reserves.

## Maps

leaf_map
```

## Maps (cont.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='asis'}

```

## Regressions {.smaller}

With all types of crime:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
x <- Full_model %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic))
y <- Reduce_model %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic))

tbl_merge(
  tbls = list(x, y),
  tab_spanner = c("**Full model**", "**Reduced model**")
)
```

No issues of multicollinearity (VIF\<5) low Adjusted R square.

## Assault and Battery

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
Assault_model_final %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic))
```

## Burglaries

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
Burglary_model_final %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic))
```

## Intentional damage and destructions

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
Damage_model_final %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic))
```

## Drug Use

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
Drug_model_final %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic))
```

## Theft without violence

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results='asis'}
Theft_model_final %>% 
  tbl_regression() %>% 
  add_glance_table(include = c(r.squared, adj.r.squared, statistic))
```

## Learnings {.smaller}

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Summary <- data.frame(
  Crime_Type = c("Assault and Battery", "Intentional Damage & Destruction", "Burglaries", "Theft without Violence", "Drug Use"),
  
  Unemployment = c("Not significant", "Not significant", "Positive", "Not significant", "Negative"),
  
  Poverty = c("Positive", "Positive", "Negative", "Not significant", "Positive"),
  
  Intensity_of_Poverty = c("Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive"),
  
  Immigration = c("Postive", "Minimal", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive"),
  
  Population_Density = c("Null", "Minimal", "Not significant", "Null", "Null"),
  
  Education_Level = c("Positive", "Not significant", "Negative", "Not significant", "Negative"),
  
  Election_results = c("Not significant", "Negative", "Not significant", "Negative", "Negative")
)
knitr::kable(Summary, format = "html")
```

## Limits of our study

No information regarding perpetrators.

Origin city of the perpetrator would be useful, crimes are not often committed in the residence city of the perpetrator.

A look at the evolution through the years would be interesting.

Tourism could have been taken as a variable, for example, the number of hotel beds.

## Conclusion

There are many disparities among territories in France.

This study provides insights on the distribution on different variables in the french territory.

Hard to draw conclusion on the impact of those factors.
